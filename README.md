# Raspberry Pi Trilateration algorithm
This code is part of a larger group project that attempts to create a tracking system by using wifi access points. 
The program contains functions for connecting to a device via web sockets, A Trilateration algorithm, and updating a very basic html web page. 
The code is written in python and is meant to be implemented in a raspberry pi.
